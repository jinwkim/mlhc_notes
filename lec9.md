## IBM pitched Watson as a revolution in cancer care
* Watson was biased toward American patients and methods of care, poor performance at foreign hospitals
* Treatment recommendations were trained on by human overseers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (NY), clinicans were inclined to input their own recommendations into Watson
* Watson was only rudimentary, nothing revolutionary
* Many hospitals don't have medical records linked, not enough data in the system
* Watson was not exposed to critical review by outside researchers and scientists, no clinical trials to review assess its effectiveness
* MD Anderson
	* More than 3 years and $60 million investment
	* Watson could not extract information from medical records in an efficient manner
	* Difficulty in deploying in clinical practice, how to ensure AI does no harm?

## Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE)
* CPOE is a process of electronic entry of medical instructions for treatment of patients under care
* CPOE reduced error rates by 55% at Brigham Women's, medication erros fell by 88%, reduced long-term healthcare costs
	* CPOE can prompt warnings for drug interaction, allergy, or overdose
	* CPOE can prompt accurate and current information on drugs

## FDA Regulation
* De novo request process to classify
	* Often need to submit rigorous studies to validate
