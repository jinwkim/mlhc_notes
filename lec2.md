## Goals of Healthcare
* According to WHO, "health" is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absense of disease or infirmity"
	* Social aspects are difficult to measure
* Life expectancy has increased from average of 48 years in 1950 to 70 years in 2012
* Causes of death in USA
	* Highest cause: heart disease, 23.4%
	* Next highest: cancer, 22.5%
* Morbidity
	* Top chronic condition in populations >= 65 years old - arthritis, 49.6%
* Time scale in medicine - cure (acute illness), manage (long-term, chronic illness), prevent, predict

## Tasks of Healthcare
* Diagnosis - identifying disease from its signs and symptoms
* Prognosis - prospect of recovery as anticipated from disease
* Therapy - medical treatment
* How does the health system learn?
	* Evidence-based medicine
	* Randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) - is A or B more effective for condition X?
* Current defiencies in system
	* How to store and analyze **"big data"**?
	* How to build longitudinal records integrating clinical, social, behavioral data?
* Prevention / Public Health
	* Tracking diseases

## Paying for Healthcare
* Lots of waste, ~50% of health expenses occur in last year of life (unnecessary procedures?)

## Managed Care
* ObamaCare
	* Promote universal coverage where everyone must get insurance
	* Insurnace companies cannot deny insurance, cancel coverage
	* Health Information Technology (HIT) to smooth out flow of info
	* Cost savings from moving towards evidence-based medicine, value-based care
	* Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs)
* Hospital readmissions reduction program
